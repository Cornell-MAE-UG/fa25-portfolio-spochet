Fluid Mechanical Dissection for MAE 3230: Introductory Fluid Mechanics


For this project, my group conducted a fluid-mechanical dissection of a V-twin four-piston engine, focusing on the carburetor as our primary fluid-mechanical component. The carburetor sets the air–fuel ratio by regulating the fuel flow and mixing it with the intake air. Using the analytical framework from MAE 3230, we examined how pressure/velocity changes in the venturi influence fuel flow into the airstream and ultimately establish the air–fuel mixture. My role centered on the quantitative modeling of the fuel pathway: calculating the Reynolds number, estimating viscous pressure losses, and using these results to predict fuel mass-flow rate and the resulting air–fuel ratio.
