Fluid Mechanical Dissection for MAE 3230: Introductory Fluid Mechanics


For our fluid-mechanical dissection, our group examined a V-twin four-piston engine and chose to focus on the carburetor—the component responsible for metering and mixing fuel with incoming air before combustion. Although the carburetor appears mechanically simple, its operation is governed almost entirely by fluid mechanics: pressure differentials generated by the venturi, shear-driven fuel atomization, buoyancy regulation in the float chamber, and unsteady flow effects tied to engine speed. By disassembling the device and analyzing its geometry, flow passages, and governing parameters, we connected its behavior directly to the conservation laws discussed in MAE 3230. Our goal was not only to document how each subsystem functions but to explain why the carburetor works, using quantitative estimates, Reynolds number analysis, and scaling arguments that reveal the sensitivity of its performance to bore diameter, throat curvature, and jet design. Through this dissection, we aimed to build an engineer’s understanding of a ubiquitous mechanical system by grounding its function in measurable, analyzable fluid phenomena.
