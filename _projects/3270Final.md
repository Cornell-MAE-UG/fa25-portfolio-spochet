Final Homework for MAE 3270: Mechanics of Materials

For the design phase of the torque-wrench project, I developed an updated instrumented wrench that met sensitivity and structural requirements using both analytical methods and finite-element modeling. Starting from a steel baseline that produced insufficient strain for measurement, I redesigned the wrench using Ti-6Al-4V to improve strength-to-weight performance and allow higher measurable strain without compromising safety. I validated the new rectangular geometry with beam theory and ANSYS simulations, confirming that maximum stress, crack-growth resistance, and fatigue life all exceeded required safety factors outlined in the assignment. To achieve the target electrical output, I implemented a full-bridge strain-gauge configuration, which doubled the mV/V sensitivity compared to the baseline and produced a predicted 1.45 mV/V response under load. This design workflow combined materials selection, structural optimization, and instrumentation—demonstrated my ability to integrate mechanical analysis with practical sensing considerations to engineer a functional measurement tool.
