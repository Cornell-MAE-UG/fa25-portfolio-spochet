Final Project for MAE 3260: System Dynamics

As part of a collaborative group project, I helped design and analyze a closed-loop thermostat model that captures how indoor temperature responds to both control inputs and environmental disturbances. Our team developed a physics-based model meant ot simulate a household heating system in MATLAB/Simulink and implemented a PD controller to regulate room temperature. 
My contributions focused on modeling outside-temperature disturbance effects, linearizing the system around an operating point, and generating transfer functions to study disturbance propagation through the closed-loop. I performed frequency-response analysis to quantify how the controller attenuates low-frequency ambient fluctuations. Working in a team allowed us to integrate subsystem designs smoothly while tying together modeling, controls, and simulation aspects of the course into a cohesive system-level analysis.
